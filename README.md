# short description (or, a summery)
This is the OpenHex project, it is for LFS systems, but the programs (hextools or hexcores) can be used anywhere, and I honestly encourage you to. Also, I'm not at all related/affiliated with any other repo/project/OS named HexOS or OpenHex.

# Current Information (Check in here daily!)
As of now, the project is still in development, but I made this repo so you can see and follow my progress, or add suggestions and possibly help me. You can check in on the PROTOTYPE branch to see any prototypes of hextools or hexcores.
